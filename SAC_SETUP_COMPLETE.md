# SAC Implementation Complete - Ready to Train

## Overview

Successfully created SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) implementation for rocket landing in two variants:
1. **Plain Surface** - `final_phase/plain_sac/`
2. **Uneven Terrain** - `final_phase/uneven_sac/`

## What Was Created

### Plain SAC (`plain_sac/`)
- ✅ `rocket_env.py` - Gymnasium-compatible continuous environment
- ✅ `train_sac.py` - SAC training script with Stable-Baselines3
- ✅ `utils.py` - Utility functions
- ✅ `landing.jpg`, `hover.jpg` - Background images
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation

### Uneven SAC (`uneven_sac/`)
- ✅ `rocket_env.py` - Continuous environment with terrain generation
- ✅ `train_sac.py` - SAC training script for uneven terrain
- ✅ `utils.py` - Utility functions
- ✅ `landing.jpg`, `hover.jpg` - Background images
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation

## Key Differences: SAC vs PPO

### Action Space
- **PPO**: Discrete (9 actions) - 3 thrust levels × 3 nozzle angles
- **SAC**: Continuous - thrust [0.2g, 2.0g], nozzle angle [-30°, +30°]

### Training Efficiency
- **PPO**: 2.4M timesteps (~8 hours) for convergence
- **SAC**: 500K timesteps (~1-2 hours) expected for similar/better results

### Algorithm Type
- **PPO**: On-policy (requires fresh data)
- **SAC**: Off-policy (learns from replay buffer)

### Expected Performance
| Variant | PPO Results | SAC Expected |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Plain | +75 to +95 | +80 to +100 |
| Uneven | +40 to +150 | +50 to +120 |

## Dependencies Status

✅ **All required packages are already installed:**
- stable-baselines3
- gymnasium
- numpy
- torch
- matplotlib
- opencv-python

## Ready to Train

Both SAC implementations are ready to run. Training commands:

### Plain Surface SAC
```bash
cd C:\Users\abhir\Desktop\rl_case\final_phase\plain_sac
python train_sac.py
```

### Uneven Terrain SAC
```bash
cd C:\Users\abhir\Desktop\rl_case\final_phase\uneven_sac
python train_sac.py
```

## Expected Timeline

- **Each training**: ~1-2 hours
- **Total for both**: ~2-4 hours (vs 16 hours for PPO)
- **Checkpoints**: Saved every 50K timesteps
- **Final models**: Automatically saved after completion
- **Graphs**: Auto-generated and saved

## Advantages of SAC

1. **5-10x more sample efficient** than PPO
2. **Continuous control** for realistic thrust/nozzle adjustments
3. **Faster convergence** due to off-policy learning
4. **Better final performance** expected
5. **Smoother landings** with precise control
6. **Automatic entropy tuning** for optimal exploration

## What Happens During Training

1. Environment creates random initial states
2. SAC agent explores with continuous actions
3. Experiences stored in replay buffer (100K capacity)
4. Model learns from batches of 256 samples
5. Models saved every 50K timesteps
6. Training logs written to CSV files
7. Graphs auto-generated at completion

## Output Locations

### Plain SAC
- Models: `plain_sac/SAC_preTrained/`
- Logs: `plain_sac/SAC_logs/training_log.csv`
- Graphs: `plain_sac/training_graphs/sac_plain_training_progress.png`

### Uneven SAC
- Models: `uneven_sac/SAC_preTrained_uneven/`
- Logs: `uneven_sac/SAC_logs_uneven/training_log.csv`
- Graphs: `uneven_sac/training_graphs/sac_uneven_training_progress.png`

**Status**: ✅ Ready to start training
**Recommendation**: Run both in sequence (plain first, then uneven) or in parallel if you have multi-core CPU
**Estimated Completion**: 2-4 hours for both trainings
