## 📊 Training Progress Analysis

### Phase 1: Initial Learning (0-100K steps)
- Rapid exploration
- High variance in rewards
- Learning basic control

### Phase 2: Skill Development (100K-200K steps)
- Improved landing precision
- Reduced crashes
- Better thrust management

### Phase 3: Optimization (200K-287K steps)
- Peak performance reached (+690)
- Consistent +70-80 average rewards
- Fine-tuned continuous control

## 🎯 Landing Success Criteria

For successful landing:
- ✅ Vertical velocity < 15 m/s
- ✅ Horizontal position within ±50m of target
- ✅ Angle < 10° from vertical
- ✅ Angular velocity < 10°/s

SAC's continuous actions allow for:
- **Precise thrust modulation** (not just 3 discrete levels)
- **Smooth nozzle control** (continuous -30° to +30°)
- **Better landing approach** optimization

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why SAC Outperformed PPO

1. **Continuous Control**: More realistic and precise than discrete 9-action space
2. **Off-Policy Learning**: Learns from replay buffer, reuses past experiences
3. **Sample Efficiency**: Updates more frequently from stored transitions
4. **Automatic Entropy**: Balances exploration vs exploitation automatically
5. **Actor-Critic Architecture**: Separate policy and value networks

### Learning Behavior

- **Early Stage**: Exploration-heavy, learning to avoid crashes
- **Mid Stage**: Developing landing strategies
- **Late Stage**: Fine-tuning for optimal landings
