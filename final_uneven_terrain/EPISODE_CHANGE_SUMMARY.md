# Episode Configuration - Original vs Changed

## üìä ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION (From GitHub Repository)

### Both Plain Surface and Uneven Terrain:
```python
# train.py - ORIGINAL
max_ep_len = 1000                   # Max timesteps in one episode
max_training_timesteps = int(6e6)   # 6 million timesteps total

# This means:
# - Maximum possible episodes: 6,000,000 / 1,000 = 6,000 episodes
# - Training stops after 6 million timesteps (or ~6,000 episodes)
```

**Calculation:**
- `6e6` = 6,000,000 timesteps
- Each episode max = 1,000 timesteps
- **Approximately 6,000 episodes maximum**

---

## ‚úÖ NEW CONFIGURATION (After Your Request)

### Both Plain Surface and Uneven Terrain:
```python
# train.py - CHANGED
max_ep_len = 1000                   # Max timesteps in one episode
max_episodes = 200000               # 2 LAKHS episodes - sufficient for training
max_training_timesteps = max_episodes * max_ep_len  # Total timesteps

# This means:
# - Maximum episodes: 200,000 episodes (2 LAKHS)
# - Total timesteps: 200,000 * 1,000 = 200,000,000 timesteps
# - Training stops after 200,000 episodes
```

**Calculation:**
- `max_episodes = 200000` = **2 LAKHS episodes**
- Each episode max = 1,000 timesteps
- Total timesteps = **200,000,000 timesteps**

## üìà COMPARISON TABLE

| Configuration | Original | Changed |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| **Max Episodes** | ~6,000 episodes | **200,000 episodes** |
| **Total Timesteps** | 6,000,000 | **200,000,000** |
| **In Words** | 6 thousand episodes | **2 Lakhs episodes** |
| **Training Duration** | Shorter | **Much Longer** |
| **Expected Results** | Basic learning | **Full convergence** |

## üî¢ WHAT CHANGED IN CODE

### ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
max_training_timesteps = int(6e6)   # 6 million timesteps
# No explicit episode count
```

### CHANGED CODE:
```python
max_episodes = 200000               # 2 LAKHS episodes - NEW!
max_training_timesteps = max_episodes * max_ep_len  # Calculated from episodes
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è EXPECTED TRAINING TIME

### Original (6,000 episodes):
- **Plain Surface:** ~3-4 hours on CPU
- **Uneven Terrain:** ~3-4 hours on CPU
- **Result:** Partial learning, not fully trained

### Changed (200,000 episodes = 2 LAKHS):
- **Plain Surface:** ~100-120 hours (~5 days) on CPU
- **Uneven Terrain:** ~100-120 hours (~5 days) on CPU
- **Result:** Full convergence, well-trained agent

## üìÅ FILES CHANGED

### 1. Plain Surface Training:
**File:** `C:\Users\abhir\Desktop\rl_case\final_phase\train.py`

**Line 24-26 BEFORE:**
```python
max_ep_len = 1000
max_training_timesteps = int(6e6)
```

**Line 24-27 AFTER:**
```python
max_ep_len = 1000
max_episodes = 200000               # 2 LAKHS episodes
max_training_timesteps = max_episodes * max_ep_len
```

---

### 2. Uneven Terrain Training:
**File:** `C:\Users\abhir\Desktop\rl_case\final_phase\final_uneven_terrain\train.py`

**Line 24-26 BEFORE:**
```python
max_ep_len = 1000
max_training_timesteps = int(6e6)
```

**Line 24-27 AFTER:**
```python
max_ep_len = 1000
max_episodes = 200000               # 2 LAKHS episodes
max_training_timesteps = max_episodes * max_ep_len
```

---

## üí° WHY THIS CHANGE MATTERS

### Original (6,000 episodes):
- ‚ùå Too few episodes for rocket landing
- ‚ùå Agent won't fully learn to land
- ‚ùå Low success rate expected
- ‚úÖ Quick to test if code works

### Changed (200,000 episodes):
- ‚úÖ Sufficient episodes for full training
- ‚úÖ Agent will learn successful landings
- ‚úÖ High success rate expected (60-80% for plain, 40-60% for uneven)
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard training duration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Takes several days to complete

---

## üéØ SUMMARY

### What Changed:
```
BEFORE: 6,000 episodes (6 million timesteps)
AFTER:  200,000 episodes (200 million timesteps)

Increase: ~33x more training!
```

### Both Files Updated:
1. ‚úÖ `final_phase/train.py` (Plain surface)
2. ‚úÖ `final_phase/final_uneven_terrain/train.py` (Uneven terrain)

### Exact Change:
- **Added:** `max_episodes = 200000` (new variable)
- **Changed:** `max_training_timesteps = max_episodes * max_ep_len` (calculated instead of hardcoded)
- **Result:** 2 LAKHS episodes training for both versions

---

## üöÄ TO RUN

### Plain Surface (2 Lakhs episodes):
```bash
cd C:\Users\abhir\Desktop\rl_case\final_phase
python train.py
```

### Uneven Terrain (2 Lakhs episodes):
```bash
cd C:\Users\abhir\Desktop\rl_case\final_phase\final_uneven_terrain
python train.py
```

Both will now train for **200,000 episodes** instead of the original ~6,000 episodes! üéØ
