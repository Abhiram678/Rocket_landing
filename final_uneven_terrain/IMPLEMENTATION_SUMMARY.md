## 🎯 What Was Changed

### 1. **Terrain Generation System** (`rocket.py`)

#### New Methods:
- **`generate_terrain(difficulty)`**: Creates procedurally generated terrain with craters and hills
  - Uses Gaussian-based features for realistic terrain
  - Smoothing for natural appearance
  - Configurable difficulty levels

- **`get_terrain_height(x_pos)`**: Returns terrain height at any x-position
  - Linear interpolation between terrain points
  - Used for collision detection and landing checks

- **`draw_terrain(canvas)`**: Renders terrain visually
  - Brown/earth-colored terrain fill
  - Darker outline for terrain surface
  - Integrated with existing rendering system

#### Modified Methods:
- **`__init__()`**: Added terrain parameters
  ```python
  terrain_difficulty='moderate'  # easy, moderate, hard
  enable_terrain=True
  ```

- **`check_crash(state)`**: Updated collision detection
  - Now checks against terrain surface height, not flat ground
  - Considers terrain height at rocket's x-position
  
- **`check_landing_success(state)`**: Updated landing validation
  - Validates landing on uneven surface
  - Checks proximity to target zone on terrain

- **`create_polygons()`**: Updated target rendering
  - Landing target positioned at terrain surface height
  - Adapts to terrain elevation

### 2. **Training Configuration** (`train.py`)

#### New Parameters:
```python
env_name = "RocketLanding_UnevenTerrain"
enable_terrain = True
terrain_difficulty = 'moderate'  # 'easy', 'moderate', 'hard'
```

#### Environment Initialization:
```python
env = Rocket(
    max_steps=max_ep_len, 
    task=task, 
    rocket_type='starship',
    enable_terrain=enable_terrain,
    terrain_difficulty=terrain_difficulty
)
```

## 🌍 Terrain Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | Features | Max Height Variation | Crater Depth |
|------------|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Easy**   | 3        | 15 meters          | 10 meters    |
| **Moderate** | 5      | 25 meters          | 15 meters    |
| **Hard**   | 8        | 40 meters          | 20 meters    |

## 🚀 How It Works

### Terrain Generation Process:
1. Create 100 terrain points from x_min to x_max
2. Start with flat base at y=0
3. Add random features (craters/hills) at random locations:
   - **Craters**: Negative Gaussian bumps (depressions)
   - **Hills**: Positive Gaussian bumps (elevations)
4. Apply smoothing for natural appearance
5. Store as interpolatable height map

### During Training:
- **Each episode**: Same terrain configuration (for now)
- **Collision detection**: Checks rocket's y-position vs terrain height at x-position
- **Landing validation**: Requires safe landing on terrain surface within target zone
- **Visual rendering**: Brown terrain drawn beneath rocket

python train.py
```

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### Collision Detection Logic:
```python
terrain_height = self.get_terrain_height(x)  # Get surface height
if y <= terrain_height + self.H/2.0 and v >= 15.0:
    crash = True  # Hit terrain too fast
```

### Landing Success Logic:
```python
terrain_height = self.get_terrain_height(x)
success = (
    y <= terrain_height + H/2.0 and  # At terrain level
    v < 15.0 and                      # Safe velocity
    abs(x - target_x) < target_r and  # Within target zone
    abs(theta) < 10°                  # Upright orientation
)
```

## 💡 Why This Is Harder

**Flat Surface Landing:**
- Same landing zone every episode
- Predictable surface at y=0
- Easy to learn landing pattern

**Uneven Terrain Landing:**
- Variable surface heights (-20m to +25m on moderate)
- Must land within target zone despite terrain features
- Requires adapting to surface slope
- More challenging reward landscape
- Longer training time needed

---

## 📈 Expected Training Performance

- **Initial reward**: -180 to -200 (similar to flat)
- **Convergence time**: 8-10M timesteps (vs 4-6M for flat)
- **Success rate**: 40-60% after full training on moderate
- **Challenge**: Agent must learn robust landing strategy

## 🎯 Ready to Use!

The uneven terrain implementation is **fully functional** and ready for training. The existing graph plotting from the base code will work automatically - no visualization changes needed as requested.

**Start training with:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\abhir\Desktop\rl_case\final_phase\final_uneven_terrain
python train.py
```

The training will save:
- **Checkpoints**: `PPO_preTrained/RocketLanding_UnevenTerrain/`
- **Logs**: `PPO_logs/RocketLanding_UnevenTerrain/`
- **Graphs**: Automatically generated (same as original)
